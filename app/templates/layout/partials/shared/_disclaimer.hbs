<div class="container-disclaimer">
  <p><strong>IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES:</strong> The simulation results produced by Nest Egg Guru’s calculators are hypothetical in nature, do not reflect actual investment results, and provide no assurance of future returns.  Instead, these calculators are intended as educational tools to help users generally assess their retirement planning preparedness and to help them understand how changing the various inputs that are within their control may impact the results. While Nest Egg Guru believes the information presented may be instructive in helping users plan for retirement, it is important to understand that no calculator is a crystal ball and that the calculators are not intended to predict future returns.</p>

  <p>Similarly, it is important to understand the limitations of this or any other retirement calculator application. First, while considerable thought has gone into designing portfolio models that realistically represent individual investor experiences, the degree to which the index models used in Nest Egg Guru differ from the actual users' portfolios may affect the applicability of the results. Second, the choice of indices and the time periods from which the monthly index return data were sampled may have a significant effect on the outcomes and might produce different results if different indices and/or time periods were chosen.  Third, because Nest Egg Guru's results are derived from random sampling of historical monthly returns data, there is an underlying assumption that future returns will at least be somewhat similar to what they have been in the recent past. Fourth, users should be aware that, as with all simulation-based calculators, results may vary from one simulation to the next. Lastly, while Nest Egg Guru believes the methodology chosen in this calculator has certain advantages, other calculators using different methodologies may produce different results.</p>

  <p>The 5,000 simulation results presented herein were produced using a sampling methodology called “bootstrapping”.   The simulations were generated from monthly equity index return data from 1970-2013.  The S&amp;P 500 Index is employed as the proxy for large cap U.S. Stocks, international stocks are represented by the MSCI EAFE Index, and small and mid-cap stocks are represented by the Russell 2000 Index.  Nest Egg Guru also holds monthly index data for the Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate Bond Index, 10-year treasuries, and one year treasuries.  However, as noted on the inputs page, the option to include these indices has been intentionally suppressed in the current low interest rate environment.</p>

  <p>The Nest Egg Guru calculators are made available to you as educational tools for your independent use and are not intended as a substitute for professional retirement planning guidance or advice. While it is hoped that these tools help you identify important factors to consider in planning your retirement, for specific portfolio guidance, users are encouraged to consult with a trusted financial planning professional.</p>
