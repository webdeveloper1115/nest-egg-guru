			<h2>Benefits</h2>
			<ul class="basic-list">
				<li>Helps make your website a hub for clients and prospective clients to frequent. Traffic may increase as users refer others to your calculators.</li>
				<li>Both the application and the printed reports are custom branded to your practice.</li>
				<li>Sleek, intuitive design and visually appealing graphics make the calculators just plain cool to use! Clients will love the ability to run the apps and print the output reports on their own.</li>
				<li>Helps differentiate you from other financial professionals. Nest Egg Guruâ€™s calculators include several unique features and the results reporting allows users to view their retirement strategies in a whole new light.</li>
				<li>Inexpensive pricing. Compare the subscription price of Nest Egg Guru to other popular branded financial planning apps. Most competing apps cost more than $1,000 per year and do not have Nest Egg Guru's functionality.</li>
